# Some additional clarifications regarding the project:
    1. This project is directed only to the heads of departments and not others.
    2. Each department head uses it only on his level.
       1. Uses it to add levels (L1, L2, ..).
       2. Use it to add units (L1:math1,Analys1, ..).
       3. Use it to add students and groups.
       4. Use it to enter points.
       5.  calculate rates(Moyenne), extract student point statement(relv√©).
# More details
    You don't need to know the names of all the units, the names of all the metrics, etc.
    This work is done by the head of the department who will use this program.
    Of course, in order to test the work of the program, we will choose a specific department.
    However, the program will still be usable by any department. Another point regarding the scale rate calculation: 
        You can use the 40% 60% rule. 
        Or giving the department head the freedom to choose the percentage he wants (thus is better) according to the level.
